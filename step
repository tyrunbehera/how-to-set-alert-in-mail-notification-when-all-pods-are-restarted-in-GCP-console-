To set up an alert for pod restart events in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can utilize the following steps:

Enable Stackdriver Monitoring: Ensure that Stackdriver Monitoring is enabled for your GCP project. Stackdriver is a monitoring and logging service provided by Google Cloud.

Create a Log-based Metric: Create a log-based metric that captures pod restart events. The metric will be used to trigger the alert. Follow these steps:

Go to the Stackdriver Metrics Explorer.
Click on "Create Metric."
Configure the metric as follows:
Service: Select "Kubernetes Container."
Metric: Choose "kubernetes.io/container/restart_count."
Filter: Add a filter for the specific pods or namespaces you want to monitor. For example, you can use the filter resource.labels.namespace_id = "your-namespace" to monitor a specific namespace.
Aggregator: Select "Count."
Click on "Create Metric" to save the configuration.
Create an Alert Policy: Now, you'll create an alert policy based on the log-based metric you defined earlier. Follow these steps:

Go to the Stackdriver Monitoring Alerting page.
Click on "Create Policy."
Configure the policy as follows:
Add Condition: Click on "Add Condition" and set the condition as follows:
Configuration: Choose "Metric Threshold."
Filter: Select the log-based metric you created in step 2.
Condition: Specify the conditions that will trigger the alert. For example, you can set the threshold to "is above" 0 to trigger the alert whenever a pod restart occurs.
Add Notification Channel: Click on "Add Notification Channel" and select your desired notification channel (e.g., email).
Notification: Configure the email notification settings, such as recipients and email subject.
Click on "Save" to create the alert policy.
Once the above steps are completed, you will receive email notifications whenever a pod restart event occurs based on the conditions you defined in the alert policy.
